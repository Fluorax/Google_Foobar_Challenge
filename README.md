# Google_Foobar_Challenge
Documentation of secret hiring process embedded within Google. Each level has a unique problem that can be solved using Python or Java. 

Level 1: Minion Labor Shifts
===================

Commander Lambda's minions are upset! They're given the worst jobs on the whole space station, and some of them are starting to complain that even those worst jobs are being allocated unfairly. If you can fix this problem, it'll prove your chops to Commander Lambda so you can get promoted!

Minions' tasks are assigned by putting their ID numbers into a list, one time for each day they'll work that task. As shifts are planned well in advance, the lists for each task will contain up to 99 integers. When a minion is scheduled for the same task too many times, they'll complain about it until they're taken off the task completely. Some tasks are worse than others, so the number of scheduled assignments before a minion will refuse to do a task varies depending on the task.  You figure you can speed things up by automating the removal of the minions who have been assigned a task too many times before they even get a chance to start complaining.

Write a function called solution(data, n) that takes in a list of less than 100 integers and a number n, and returns that same list but with all of the numbers that occur more than n times removed entirely. The returned list should retain the same ordering as the original list - you don't want to mix up those carefully-planned shift rotations! For instance, if data was [5, 10, 15, 10, 7] and n was 1, solution(data, n) would return the list [5, 15, 7] because 10 occurs twice, and thus was removed from the list entirely.

Level 2a: Elevator Maintenance
====================

You've been assigned the onerous task of elevator maintenance - ugh! It wouldn't be so bad, except that all the elevator documentation has been lying in a disorganized pile at the bottom of a filing cabinet for years, and you don't even know what elevator version numbers you'll be working on. 

Elevator versions are represented by a series of numbers, divided up into major, minor and revision integers. New versions of an elevator increase the major number, e.g. 1, 2, 3, and so on. When new features are added to an elevator without being a complete new version, a second number named "minor" can be used to represent those new additions, e.g. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc. Small fixes or maintenance work can be represented by a third number named "revision", e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.0, and so on. The number zero can be used as a major for pre-release versions of elevators, e.g. 0.1, 0.5, 0.9.2, etc (Commander Lambda is careful to always beta test her new technology, with her loyal henchmen as subjects!).

Given a list of elevator versions represented as strings, write a function solution(l) that returns the same list sorted in ascending order by major, minor, and revision number so that you can identify the current elevator version. The versions in list l will always contain major numbers, but minor and revision numbers are optional. If the version contains a revision number, then it will also have a minor number.

For example, given the list l as ["1.1.2", "1.0", "1.3.3", "1.0.12", "1.0.2"], the function solution(l) would return the list ["1.0", "1.0.2", "1.0.12", "1.1.2", "1.3.3"]. If two or more versions are equivalent but one version contains more numbers than the others, then these versions must be sorted ascending based on how many numbers they have, e.g ["1", "1.0", "1.0.0"]. The number of elements in the list l will be at least 1 and will not exceed 100.
